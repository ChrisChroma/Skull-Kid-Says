## Getting Started

When the player opens the game up, they can select a theme with a background song to alongside it. They then push the start button and the game begins with a random color being flashed to the player, which the player must correctly choose the flashed color. The game will then continue, and add another color to the sequence with each new round. The game ends when the player fails to press the correct colors in the right order.
